blurb: "Step#02: In which I drill holes into the base structure of the workcell..."

In this step I drill holes in the base wooden board for the bolts that will secure the robot to the base structure. The holes in the robot base are sized for M2 bolts which is a metric measurement. M2 bolts are metric screws with an outer diameter of 2 mm and a standard pitch of 0.4 mm between threads. Since I am in the US, the RYOBI drill set I own is in the standard system which measures in inches rather than metric. So I had to use a metric to inches converter to figure out the right drill bit to use. Oh the joys..  As long as it is about flipping the Churchill to the imperialists of a bygone era…I am ok with the joys of this dual system. Long live Freedom!!
