<p>Bought this quiet compressor (60dB) from Menards for attaching to the vacuum gripper. Some coupling adaptors are needed since the pipe that came with the vacuum gripper has a 6 mm diameter and the tube that came with a compressor is ¼ inch. Could not find a coupler in stock in any of the stores. Even tried AutoZone since I was told automotive shops are big on air compressors.
Anyways, had to fall back on trusty Amazon.com and it was a breeze. I now need to put everything together and try it out. There is a concern around the solenoid or the 6 mm pipe blowing up on me due to air pressure. I am going to be extra careful before letting in any high pressure air through the vacuum gripper. I can’t afford any unnecessary and costly accidents. Might go for a smaller, lower pressure compressor. Fingers crossed.</p>

This video does not quite show the extent of trial and error and working with the robot support call center that went into getting it to work.</p>

<p>The alternative is to use more mature industrial robotic systems like FANUC or Kuka. These are highly mature but expensive industrial robotic solutions. Many of the kinks and issues are already taken care of in these robots, so they may be easier to work with. Go to the exchange about FANUC robots, at the 14 min. time stamp in this video, to see what I’m referring to.</p>

<p>Robots from startups require a lot more figuring out, hacking, perseverance and also technical expertise. So why did I inflict this on myself? ‘Price’ is the single word answer. The robot I chose while still expensive for my budget was relatively cheaper than the FANUC robots which I was looking at earlier. For instance the cheapest models from firms like FANUC and KUKA start in the 30-50K range. I’ve trained on FANUC robots as part of a college level course on industrial robotics. Yet I could not use them because of the steep price point.</p>

<p>I might still go for FANUC robots (for their reliability) in a final industrial grade version of my robotic solution. However, for the piloting phase I decided to go for a cheaper alternative with the knowledge that I’ll have to do some hacking around to figure out the robot. Those are the choices I’ve made and I’m happy with them. Your unique situation might need different choices.</p>
