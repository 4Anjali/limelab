### Why

<span style="font-size: 2em; line-height: 0.5;">P</span>rior to 2020, a substantial number of Detroit Public Schools Community District (DPSCD) students lacked access to personal computing devices and reliable internet at home. In response, the Connected Futures initiative provided over 44,000 students with wireless tablets and internet access to bridge this gap. 

Inspite of such initiatives, in the 2023-24 school year, only 15.9% of students in grades 3-8 achieved proficiency in English Language Arts, and 11.0% in Math. (Source: NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS). Over the past five years, the percentage of high school students considered college-ready has decreased from 40% to 36%. 

These statistics highlight the critical need for enhanced technology literacy programs and resources to support Detroit's students in being ready for careers in technology and STEM.


### What
We started LIME Lab in Detroit in 2015, with the goal to provide technology training to kids in the city of Detroit. In this almost decade of service, we have taught over 1200 kids pro-bono. We have partnered with local institutions like the Detroit Public Library, The Michigan Science Center, and The Michigan Council of Women In Technology.
